# django app for ajax

A decorator (@ajax) and an HttpResponseAjax for your ajax needs

Use @ajax on a view function to notify it is an ajax function.
It will cause the function to return a 412 http response in case the function 
is not called by an ajax request. This is the behavior in DEBUG = True.
With DEBUG = False, a Http404 is raised.

in @ajax decorated functions, return HttpResponseAjax responses. they will 
return json encoded responses, and they take a single argument (a dictionary)
